# HYDRA Hardware Connectivity Configuration
# Maps kernel ports to HBM banks on Alveo U280

[connectivity]
# Single compute unit instance
nk=hydra_inference:1

# HBM port mapping for CU 1 (9 ports total)
# Each argument mapped to dedicated HBM bank for maximum bandwidth

# Note: U280 has 32 HBM banks, but Vitis reserves ~1 for control
# Maximum usable: 31 HBM banks
# Current usage: 9 banks (single CU)
# Can scale to 2-3 CUs if needed (2 CUs = 18 banks, 3 CUs = 27 banks)
