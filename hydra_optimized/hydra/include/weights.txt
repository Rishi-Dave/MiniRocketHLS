# HYDRA Dictionary Kernel Weights
# 512 kernels × 9 values each = 4,608 total weights
# Format: One weight per line, kernels arranged sequentially
# Kernel 0: weights[0-8], Kernel 1: weights[9-17], ..., Kernel 511: weights[4599-4607]
#
# NOTE: This file contains placeholder random weights.
# To use trained weights, run: python scripts/train_hydra.py
# which will generate actual dictionary kernels from training data.
#
# These weights are initialized with a simple pattern for testing:
# - Positions 0, 3, 6: +1.0
# - Positions 1, 4, 7: -0.5
# - Positions 2, 5, 8: +0.5
# This creates 512 kernels with slight variations based on kernel index.
